        "   - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is known for its simple and easy-to-read syntax. It is widely used in different fields such as web development, data science, machine learning, automation, scientific computing, and software development.\n",
        "\n",
        "   The main reasons for Python’s popularity are:\n",
        "   \n",
        "   1. Easy to learn and use :- Python has a clean and simple syntax that looks like English, which makes it beginner-friendly.\n",
        "   2. Large community support :- It has a huge community, so we can easily find tutorials, documentation, and solutions to problems.\n",
        "   3. Rich libraries and frameworks :- Python provides powerful libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow, which make tasks easier, especially in data science and machine learning.\n",
        "   4. Platform independent :- Python code can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux without major changes.\n",
        "   5. Faster development :- Python requires fewer lines of code compared to other languages, which helps in rapid development."
